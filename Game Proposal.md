# Game Proposal
#### - LK119

As discussed, the game will involve a maze and have trivia type questions throughout. From here, we need to make the game multiplayer and interactive. Below are some ideas I have put together, please add to, comment on and discuss! Once we have this nailed down, I can write a proper description and add to the README.

## Goal
The player must successfully navigate each layer of the labyrinth to reach the final stage – a dance party! The player with the fastest time to navigate to the party room becomes the Party Queen / King and gets to wear the party crown!

## Game Play
The player enters the labyrinth.
From here, the player must navigate through the maze, where they will come across obstacles, helpful characters, nefarious characters, and other players.

### Obstacles
Think impaling spikes, quicksand etc. If they are hit by these or they fall in them, they spawn back to the beginning of the level. These will be static and on the “wrong way” parts of the maze.

### Helpful characters 
When the player comes across these NPCs, they will ask the player a set of 3 trivia questions. If the player gets all three correct, the chance of receiving **successful** directions is 3/3, two questions correct is 2/3, one question correct is 1/3. If they get no questions right, they will be given the wrong directions.

The player is not informed which / if any questions they have got right. There is also a time limit on answering the questions. The player does not have to go in the direction the NPC told them to.

### Nefarious characters
FYI called them this because I loved saying the word *nefarious*.

These NPCs will also ask the player 3 trivia questions; however, the player does not know they are nefarious. 

Once they have answered the questions, the nefarious NPC will either: give them the successful directions or give them unsuccessful directions if they got all 3 correct with a ***“Ha! I’m actually nefarious!”*** message. If they get no questions right, the nefarious NPC will kill them and the player will spawn back to the beginning of the level.

### Other players
Players will be able to see other players' handles but not interact on a character level. They will be able to chat to each other with the chat box.

### Levels
The levels will be similar and depending on our abilities(!!) - we could have different themes for the levels i.e. garden maze, stone maze, inside building maze. I think we need to nail one down well first before we decide if we change the look of the others.

The trivia questions will get harder on each level. 

Need to decide how many levels we will have. I think we should start with 3 and see how we get on?

Final level – Party Room: Players can hang about in the Party Room and chat to each other once the game has finished.

### Scoring / Points
Players receive 2 points for every trivia question they get correct; they lose 1 point for every trivia question they get wrong. If the player has to replay a level due to losing the trivia questions with a nefarious NPC, they lose an additional 2 points. 

Players that have to replay due to death by spikes / quicksand do not lose points.

The player receives 10 points when levelling up.

The Party Queen / King receives 50 points.

Each player has a game total and a running total. So, if they log in and play again, they keep their overall score from the previous games.

### Interaction
Players will be able to see other players' handles but not interact on a character level. They will be able to chat to each other with the chat box.

### Rules / Restrictions
Need to think of actual Game Play rules but ones for the chat:
* Be civil
* No swearing *etc..*

### Controls
WSAD or up / down / left / right arrows for moving. No other controls for moving the character are necessary.


## Design 
As our skillset is somewhat limited, I am imagining the final look of the game won’t exactly be *pristine*. I like the idea of rolling with this and going for a retro theme and stylisation!  

### Game Objects

* Player characters
* Helpful NPCs
* Nefarious NPCs
* Maze walls
* Spikes
* Quicksand
* Others?

### Sounds
Retro beeps and bops!

### Music
Need to have a search for licence free music we can play in the background. Especially a funky one for the Party Room.

### Colour Scheme
In keeping with the retro theme, I propose the use of the one of the following colour scheme:

https://colorhunt.co/palette/135910

https://colorhunt.co/palette/153606

https://colorhunt.co/palette/9506

### Font
For ease in regards to browser compatibility, I suggest we stick with a safe web font.

Courier fits with the retro theme and could be used for body text.

Haike is a retro-looking font. We could use this for titles / “game over” alerts if we save as .png:
